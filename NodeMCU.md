# NodeMCU
## Introduction to NodeMCU and IOT
### What is NodeMCU?
**NodeMCU** is an open source development board and firmware based in the widely used ESP8266-12E WiFi module. With just a few lines of code you can establish a WiFi connection and define input/output pins according to your needs exactly like arduino, turning your ESP8266 into a web server and a lot more. It is the WiFi equivalent of ethernet module. Now you have Internet of Things (IOT) real tool.
### What is IOT?
**The Internet of Things** is actually a pretty simple concept, it means taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet. So,The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, all collecting and sharing data.
## Setting up the NodeMCU Board on your laptop
1. Open Aurdino IDE.
2. Open the File and click on the **Preferences** as shown in the figure.
3. In the Additional Boards Manager enter URL- http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json. As highlighted in the figure and enter OK.
4. Now open the tools in that select **Board: “Arduino/Genuino Uno”** and click on the **Boards Manager** as shown in the figure.
5. The Boards Manager window opens, and then type in the search box-'ESP8266'. Once we get it, select that module and select version and click on the Install button. When it is installed it shows Installed in the module as shown in the figure and then close the window.
6. Select the **Board: NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)**.
7. Connect NodeMCU to your computer through USB cable.
8. Then select the port and upload the code.
